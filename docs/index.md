# Preface
This site will introduce you to basic methods to learn Japanese and useful tools you can use in the process. 
It is directed at people who want to learn Japanese efficiently through **self-study** and have a **passion for Japanese media** such as anime, manga and visual novels. 
The focus is on impartiality, showing only community approved tools, and simpleness. 

If you have questions of any sort feel free to ask in the #join-chat of the Discord server: <https://animecards.site/discord/> or check out the the [contact page](support.md) for more ways to contact me.

All software suggested on this site is available free of charge and respects your [freedom](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html). All steps are applicable to both Windows and Linux.
